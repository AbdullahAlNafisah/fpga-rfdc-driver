# FPGA-based Driver for Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC RF Data Converter

This project provides an **FPGA-based driver and supporting logic** for the **RF Data Converter (RFDC)** IP block on AMD/Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ RFSoC devices (e.g., ZCU216). The goal is to create a **lightweight, reusable driver framework** for controlling and testing the RFDC block without requiring full-featured Linux drivers.
